### Google Sheets parser

*For parsing bake shop orders from Google Forms*

---
A simple spreadsheet parser that is integrated with the Google Sheets API to allow seamless parsing of data without having to first manually export the csv file from Google Sheets. It is built using the [starter code](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python) provided by the Google Sheets API. 

This parser processes the orders I collect using Google Forms for the sales of my millionaire shortbread (see [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brd_n_bttr/) for details). Specifically, it calculates the total cost for each order (accounting for the different delivery methods), and tabulates the total number of shortbread from each flavour across all orders that I will have to make.

Sensitive information have been omitted from the code.
